# Mandelbrot

Started this project on visualising the Mandelbrot set due to boredom and wanting to refresh my knowledge on threading in Go. Fancy picture, that you've probably seen before, can be found below and, in a higher resolution, in the images folder. If you want to try the program yourself, you can download the .exe ![here](https://github.com/Isterdam/mandelbrot/raw/main/src/mandelbrot.exe).
